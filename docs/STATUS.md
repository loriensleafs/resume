# Status

Updated 2026-10-26. This file is the one current handoff. A fresh session resumes from here without the conversation.

## Where we are

- **Phase:** the knowledge module is complete. [SPEC-knowledge.md](../spec/SPEC-knowledge.md) is approved and built. All nine deep dives and all four logistics answers are approved (2026-10-26). `bun run knowledge` lists 46 entries, 31,275 of 100,000 characters.
- **Done:** `resume.yaml` and `private.yaml` replace the hand-written `resume.html`. `bun run build` makes the public and private PDF, Word and text files. The private PDF is pixel-identical to the PDF built from the hand-written `resume.html`, and the public PDF differs only on the contact line. `bun test` passes 43 tests. Brain's setup ran (local issue tracker). Agent files, decision records, research notes, the glossary and the interview record are written. History was rewritten on 2026-10-26 so that no commit holds a private detail.
- **Next:** write SPEC-site.md for Peter's review (task 9 in [tasks/todo.md](../tasks/todo.md)). After it: the chat, deploy and agents specs.
- **Open issues:** [01](../.scratch/knowledge/issues/01-markdown-parsers.md) names the streaming Markdown parsers once Peter hears from his former boss; [02](../.scratch/knowledge/issues/02-testing-harness-details.md) confirms the FedNow testing harness with a former colleague.

## Waiting on Peter

- Add `.mcp.json` and `.claude/settings.json` for Claude Code, from the README section "Working with AI agents" ([decision 0014](decisions/0014-library-skills-and-docs-mcp.md)). An agent's safety check blocks agents from writing their own configuration.
- Run `bun install` in `~/Dev/resume`, so Intent and the docs MCP server work there.
- Vercel Pro sign-up and an Anthropic API key with a workspace spend limit, when the deploy module starts ([0012](decisions/0012-vercel-pro-host.md), [0013](decisions/0013-claude-sonnet-model.md)). Peter signs up and pays; agents never do.
- Review of SPEC-site.md, once it is written.

## Working state

- Repository: github.com/loriensleafs/resume, public since 2026-10-26, branch `main`.
- Peter's local clone: `git clone https://github.com/loriensleafs/resume ~/Dev/resume`, then create `private.yaml` there (see README).
- Nothing red. CI does not exist yet; it arrives with the deploy module.
